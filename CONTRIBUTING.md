## What should I know before I get started?

This project is currently maintained but just one person. I have a usual paid job and I don't do coding at TFF3 24/7 so please keep in mind that this software is just a hobby for me and grew with my personal PHP-skills. In my real job I am quite strict with the whole MVC-Pattern but here I just wanted to create a simple solution to get websites up and running. This said, please be nice to me. I am just a human being and I do my best to have fun with coding.
