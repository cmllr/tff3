## Intro ##
TFF3 is a dead simple content-management/blog-software with some funny scripts that make your working easier. But it might be buggy as hell. I use it in production and I have waited a loooooong time to release this stuff. In fact I am not even sure, if this program runs at your environment.

## Features ##
- Blazing fast
- Some sort of template-engine
- quite simple to use
- mobile-friendly (through skeleton.css)

## Further Info ##
This is the work of several years with PHP. In fact, I'd do stuff different now, especially when it comes to separate logics from data and views (MVC) and when it comes to modularize this. Creating a full package, which is even compatible to "real" php-standards would be a step for a coming release but for now I am really happy with this software. I did my blog with it. I even did forums or shops with this babe. So, somehow this might be cool software. Some PHP-Devs just might think, this is bullshit. Nevertheless I enjoy using it and hopefully, you enjoy it, too.

## Final Infos ##

Please, please, please keep in mind that although I use Opensource a lot and I work as a dev all my life, I never released something on my own. So please don't fight me. Thankies. KTHXBYE
